## Getting Started

1. **Clone and customize**:
   ```bash
   # Clone this template
   git clone https://github.com/benvon/ai-code-template-go.git your-project-name
   cd your-project-name

   # Update go.mod with your module path
   go mod edit -module github.com/your-username/your-project-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

4. **Build locally**:
   ```bash
   go build -o ./bin/your-project-name ./
   ```

## Release Process

This project uses GoReleaser for automated releases. When you push a semantic version tag, it will:

1. Build binaries for multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows on amd64 and arm64)
2. Create GitHub releases with changelogs
3. Generate checksums
4. Upload release artifacts

### Creating a Release

1. **Tag your release**:
   ```bash
   # Create and push a tag
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Supported tag formats**:
   - `v1.0.0` - Standard release
   - `v1.0.0-beta.1` - Pre-release
   - `v1.0.0-rc.1` - Release candidate

3. **The release workflow will**:
   - Run all tests
   - Build binaries for:
     - Linux (amd64, arm64)
     - macOS (amd64, arm64)
     - Windows (amd64, arm64)
   - Create GitHub release with:
     - Release notes
     - Binary downloads
     - Checksums
     - Changelog

### Binary Naming Convention

Released binaries follow this pattern:
```
ai-code-template-go_v1.0.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
ai-code-template-go_v1.0.0_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
ai-code-template-go_v1.0.0_Windows_x86_64.zip
```

### Version Information

Built binaries include version information accessible via:
```bash
./your-binary --version
```

This displays:
- Version number
- Git commit hash
- Build date
- Built by (goreleaser)
